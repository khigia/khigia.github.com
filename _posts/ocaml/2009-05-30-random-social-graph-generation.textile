title: "Random graph generation example"
categories: ['ocaml']
---
Have been playing around with the _beautiful_ "ocamlgraph":http://ocamlgraph.lri.fr library. I also installed "xmlrpc-light":http://code.google.com/p/xmlrpc-light to draw graph through the free version of the "ubigraph":http://ubietylab.net/ubigraph server.

I wrote a tool to generate some random graph. The goal is to render graph that have the same connectivity caracteristics as social networks. The generation algorithm is inspired of the forest fire model for graph generation (propagate links to neighboorhood recursively).

The code is "online":http://github.com/khigia/socnet/tree. All is in single file _socnet.ml_, but I use code from _xmlrpc-light_ library for Ubigraph calls. There is a _Builder_ module to augment the default builder of _ocamlgraph_ with a state; a special UbigraphBuilder to replicate the graph structure for rendering; and finally the algo to generate the graph is in Gen module.

The result is a single binary:
<pre><code>
./socnet.byte
  [-n <node-number>]
  [-gv] [-ubi]
  [-fwd <forward-factor>] [-bck <backward-factor>] [-bi <linking-back-factor>]
</code></pre>
When creating an edge from a source node to some target node:
* forward factor is related to the probability to link source node to successors of a target node
* backward factor is related to the probability to link source node to predecessors of a target node
* linking back factor is related to probability to create an edge from target node to source node

Following are some screenshots of results, although it is much more interesting to watch the construction steps though Ubigraph renderer.
