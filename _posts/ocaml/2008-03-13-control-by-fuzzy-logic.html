As exercise of Ocaml, I wrote a very very simple library for inference using fuzzy logic.<br/>
There is only the bare minimum ... but it's often enough anyway ;). If someone is interested I can:
<ul>
	<li>write a small doc</li>
	<li>write a example</li>
	<li>complete some parts</li>
</ul>
This is my first <a href="http://github.com/khigia/ocaml-fuzlog">project</a> on <a href="http://github.com">GitHub</a>.
