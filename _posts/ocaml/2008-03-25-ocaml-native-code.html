I was playing with this mini <a href="http://www.ffconsultancy.com/ocaml/ray_tracer/index.html">raytracer</a> and modify it to use <a href="http://www.google.com.sg/url?sa=t&amp;ct=res&amp;cd=1&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fglcaml.sourceforge.net%2F&amp;ei=oCbpR9nRDJuq6wOx3pjICA&amp;usg=AFQjCNGRADY053g48yJdDifPbYVSpQN2zg&amp;sig2=TU9C-YxbqrfttRWSGP4oMA">glcaml</a> instead of glut.<br/>
I was delighted to see how the native code is faster than the byte compiled one ... of course this is expected but after playing for some time with the byte code I was surprise how fast the result came after the first native compilation :)<br/>
(below is google graph; time unit is second)<br/>
