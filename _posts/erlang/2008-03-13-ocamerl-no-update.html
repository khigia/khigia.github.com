Quick news about ocamerl:
<ul>
	<li>I changed the build system to ocamlbuild (need ocaml 3.10).</li>
	<li>... and that's all! can't find time to clean all the mess.</li>
</ul>
So anyway, here is the current state of ocamerl:
<ul>
	<li>ocaml can register a hidden erlang node (epmd).</li>
	<li>ocaml node can respond to ping and keep connection up with erlang node (net_kernel process)</li>
	<li>erlang can send (some) terms to named ocaml process</li>
	<li>ocaml can send (some) terms to erlang process if it received the pid in a previous message</li>
</ul>
That's all for now! Argh!<br/>
Amongst things I'd like to change:
<ul>
	<li>simplify terms manipulation in ocaml</li>
	<li>add features (most important initial message from ocaml to erlang)</li>
	<li>complete redesign of concurrency (using events or JoCaml maybe!)</li>
	<li>add a minimum of documentation</li>
</ul>
I need motivation! In fact I have no project which would need ocaml + erlang ... for now.
