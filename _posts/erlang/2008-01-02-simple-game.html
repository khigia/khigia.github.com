It's kind of surprising how people can like such a simple game as pong. Isn't it even more odd to find programmer which enjoy their program to play?<br/>
All that to say: ocaml node (using the ocamerl lib of <a href="http://code.google.com/p/erlocaml/">erlocaml</a>) can now reply pong to a ping request from erlang node ;) ... and that's all it can do!<br/>
Next step: receive data :)
