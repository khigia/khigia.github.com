Even it the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eight_queens_puzzle">8-queens puzzle</a> is often used to illustrate the recursivity principle, I never tried to solve it myself. I only wrote my N-queens solution recently (using Erlang), and was pretty happy to see that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_comprehension">list-comprehension</a> is quite good for the principle of generate-and-filter. Oh! and I tried the <a href="http://esdl.sourceforge.net/">ESDL</a> library to display the result :) ... I was just as excited as the day I did my first openGL tutorial in C.
