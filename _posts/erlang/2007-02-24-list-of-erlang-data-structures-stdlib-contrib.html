How would you implement a huge-but-sparse 2D matrix in Erlang?
<ul>
	<li>First solution who came to my mind was to google for some linear algebra library ... that failed!</li>
	<li>The second one, implement a dict-of-dict structure.</li>
</ul>
That was quite easy, but as I was wondering on efficiency I needed to understand differences between dict, orddict etc. On my way I came up with this (ongoing) <a href="http://khigia.wordpress.com/erlang-data-structures/">list of Erlang data structures</a>.
