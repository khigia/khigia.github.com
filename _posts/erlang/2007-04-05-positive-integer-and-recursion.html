I remember my first steps of Prolog, I was following an exercise to define positive integer as a recursion of the same function ... I did not really known why I did that, but it was fun to define the integers (the funniest Prolog exercise is still to write a Prolog interpretor in Prolog). Today I'm reading <a href="http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/full-text/book/book.html">SICP</a> and I just found in Ex2.6 that the recursive integer definition is the basic of lambda calculus: Church' numerals! Definitively, I have to learn this lambda calculus. At least I have now a better understanding of it (<a href="http://www.rubrication.net/2007/01/13/addition-in-the-lambda-calculus/">thanks also to this post</a>) and I wrote <a href="http://paste.lisp.org/display/39267">the addition and multiplication operators in Erlang</a>.
