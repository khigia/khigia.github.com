It took a long time to decide <a href="http://khigia.wordpress.com/2006/11/02/what-is-my-next-programming-language/" title="to learn Erlang instead of Haskell or OCaml/F#">to learn Erlang instead of Haskell or OCaml/F#</a>. What I really want to learn for now are the OTP principles of distributed application. So I wrote my first Erlang script (not yet an application) and it confirmed my point of view: Erlang make easy the development of distributed program! really!!!<br/>
At my work we needed to test performance of a TCP server (and we'll used Grinder because most of our API is Python). I've decided to use Erlang to do the same thing as an exercise: grind.erl (of course it will never become neither as huge as <a href="http://grinder.sourceforge.net/" title="Grinder">Grinder</a> neither as efficient as <a href="http://tsung.erlang-projects.org/" title="Tsung">Tsung</a>; I even do not hope it can be usefull). But with few lines of code, I was able to reproduce the same behavior as Grinder: launch on multiple machine multiple tester agents executing some test function and gather the results of all the tests.<br/>
Ok, I did not told all the truth: that's not a very small number of lines: arround 260 (with tests and all). But all the code is for running multiple time a test function and gathering some statistics on its result (run_task). Distributed this behaviour among multiple Erlang node is only a map call (distribute_task)!<br/>
Here is a code extract:
<pre>
distribute_task(NodeLst, Task) -&gt;
    NodeLstLen = length(NodeLst),
    StatListener = spawn(grind, statistic_gathering, [now(), NodeLstLen]),
    io:format(
        "~w create statistic gathering process ~w on node ~w~n",
        [self(), StatListener, node()]
    ),
    TaskRunnerCreator = fun(Node) -&gt; spawn(
        Node,
        grind,
        run_task,
        [StatListener, Task]
    ) end,
    Runners = lists:map(TaskRunnerCreator, NodeLst),
    io:format(
        "~w create a list of task runners: ~w~n",
        [self(), Runners]
    ),
    Runners.</pre>
And here is a usage example:
<pre>
grind:init([node(), grinderl@node.net]).
grind:distribute_task(
        [node(), grinderl@node.net], % use 2 nodes
        {
            % on each node run the test function in 50 concurrent process
            {concurrent, 50},
            % two statistics to gather
            [{mean, writetime}, % a real value (mean, std. dev., min, max, med will be retrieved
             {count, writer_val} % a occurence counter
            ],
            % foo function to test: must return a tuple {ok|error, Pid, ValLst}
            fun(Writer, WritenValue) -&gt;
                FWrite = fun() -&gt; io:format("~s got ~w~n", [Writer, WritenValue]) end,
                {WriteTime, _Res} = timeit(FWrite),
                {ok, self(), [WriteTime, {Writer, WritenValue}]}
            end,
            % arguments to used for each call of the test function
            [{rr, ["bea", "pouf"]}, % first is taken in the list with a round-robin style
             {choice, [0, 1, 12, 42, 77]} % second argument is randomly choosen from the list
            ]
        }
    )</pre>
This first steps was to become more familiar with Erlang language. My next steps will be:
<ul>
	<li>     use edoc ...</li>
	<li>     use logger/trace services instead of printing every function call</li>
	<li>     use generic services (gen_event, gen_server)</li>
	<li>     create an OTP application (application, supervisor)</li>
	<li>     use Mnesia to gather statistics</li>
	<li>       what about OTP release</li>
	<li>     embed everything in distribution package (automake/autoconf ?)</li>
</ul>
