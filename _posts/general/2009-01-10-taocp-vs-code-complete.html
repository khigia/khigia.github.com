Surprising! as of now, in my experiences of software engineer, I met more people that read/know about <a href="http://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~knuth/taocp.html">TAOCP</a> than people who read <a href="http://cc2e.com/">Code Complete</a>.<br/>
It may be a probability accident (I kind of remember that probabilities and small numbers are not good friends). It may also be influenced by my fields of experiences. But assuming this is real (i.e. programmers know more about TOACP), it's doesn't seems right.<br/>
I consider TAOCP as a reference to write efficient code; Code Complete is a reference to write good software (eventually being a product maintained by a team). Both are important, but the first one being used way less often!
