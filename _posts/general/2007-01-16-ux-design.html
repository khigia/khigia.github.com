I assisted to my first presentation about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_experience_design" target="_blank" title="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_experience_design" class="externalLink">User Experience Design</a> (as I discovered, UX Design is not only UX). Here is a quick summary of what I still remember.<br/>
From what I understood UX Design is defined by:
<ul>
	<li>  aesthetic</li>
	<li>  functionality</li>
	<li>  innovation</li>
	<li>  enterprise impact</li>
	<li>  human factor (~ergonomics)</li>
</ul>
A product specification can then be described by a list of features, where each feature is defined by:
<ul>
	<li>  description (what is/does it?)</li>
	<li>  functional test (how to test the functionality?)</li>
	<li>  intend or goal (what's the objective of the feature, for e.g. "make user happy")</li>
	<li>  how to test/measure the feature (particularly its goal)</li>
</ul>
Relative reading (added in my reading queue):
<ul>
	<li><em>The Design of Everyday Things</em> [Donald Norman, 1988]</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>D. Norman introduced the term affordance about user interaction, and emphasize on the design of product: "make the task dominate, make the tool invisible".</blockquote>
