Was "playing" with keyboard map and layout recently in my Ubuntu 7.10 and realized that mobile phone dedicated to SMS or email have a keyboard's layout following the PC QWERTY keyboard (e.g. Nokia E61i).<br/>
Is there any phone with a Dvorak layout? Shall we assume that phone user already know the PC keyboard and do not want to learn another one?<br/>
But could we assume that the size change imply a new learning of the keyboard usage, and this is good time to change the layout for a more appropriate one?<br/>
Is this all nonsense?
