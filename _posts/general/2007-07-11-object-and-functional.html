From a programmer perspective, how easy (difficult) is it to mix OO and functional programming?<br/>
Earlier this year, I've been reading <a href="http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/">SICP</a> and <a href="http://www.cs.bell-labs.com/cm/cs/pearls/">Programming pearls</a> at the same time; Last month, I've been writing both OO Python code and functional Erlang code. Those experiences are probably the best feeling of programming I had since a while: I'm not writing code, I am coding abstractions.<br/>
But I'm still wondering about mixing both styles/paradigms in the same project or same code file. My intuition is that it may be nice to work with different styles for different parts of a program, but I would really be afraid to introduce such kind of mix in a project maintained by multiple programmers. Any experience to share on this subject?<br/>
Perhaps I should give <a href="http://nemerle.org/Main_Page" target="_blank">Nemerle</a> a try. Any other?
