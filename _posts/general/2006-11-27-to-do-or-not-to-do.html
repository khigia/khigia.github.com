I did mistakes (I mean I discover some new ones).<br>I implemented programming tools, some of them far too quickly to provide them a good architecture. At this time, I only needed few functionalities, but as requests came I implemented some quick-fix/quick-adds. And now, even if we don't planned to use those tools any further, I have to maintain those becomed-crappy-tools!<br>Too conclusions, choose one depending of your mood:<br><ul><li>Don't do anything before to be requested to do so; don't provide tools, keep it secret.</li><li>Never implement software without specifications and stay humble: never never never do quick design before to be a expert/guru/grand-master/programming-giant/computer-god!</li></ul>
