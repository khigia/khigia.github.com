What should contain my blog-posts? (sorry, I'm quite new in blogging world...)<br/>
Anyway, question is: should I post from time to time on the music I like or should I make a web page to gather all? Ok, nobody care ... but if you have time, have a look at  <a href="http://www.musicovery.com/index.php?ct=us">musicovery</a>, it's beautiful and fit well in my graph-oriented brain (I have a dream project called orgraphizer, but it's still more a dream than a project).
