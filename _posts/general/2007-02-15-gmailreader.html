I used GReader since few months now, it works pretty well ... it's maybe too good: now I would like to read my email in GMail with the same presentation as GReader! (i.e. don't hide the other emails when I click on one, but only expand the text of the selected email).<br/>
I know about some tools to do the opposite (send email from feeds) like the excellent <a href="http://www.rssfwd.com">RSSFwd</a>. So after the question "what's the difference betweens a forum and a blog?", here comes "what's the differences between a feed and a (thread of) emails?". Can I say that every email is a feed (with one post), to which I can participate (the thread of emails becoming a feed with more than one post).<br/>
Some days I really have stupid blog post, and I'm happy to not have to read my blog :)
