I took some time to get the terminology: radix tree/trie, patricia tree/trie ... it's all the same, really:
<ul>
	<li>A trie is a multi-way tree;</li>
	<li>I guess radix term replaced the Patricia appellation because it sounds more generic (not specific to information retrieval);</li>
	<li>And in the case of radix trie, if you use the binary representation of the key, you have an alphabet of 2 and the trie become a 2-ways tree, thus radix tree :P</li>
</ul>
