In last point of one of <a href="http://khigia.wordpress.com/2007/03/31/some-articles-and-why-they-surprised-me/" target="_blank">this previous post</a> I was remembering (to me!) the need to know the roots of computer science. Since then, I read (began to...) some interesting articles on wikipedia: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_computer_science" target="_blank">history of CS</a>, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_prominent_pioneers_in_computer_science" target="_blank">  pioners</a>, the list of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_Award" target="_blank"> Turing award winners</a> ... wikipedia is really time consuming!<br/>
Curiously, it's more difficult to find a good list of modern computer scientists (or programmers, as they prefer). I like the post <a href="http://www.memestreams.net/users/pnw/blogid770893/" target="_blank">   Beautiful Code: Leading Programmers Explain How They Think</a>. Any other recommendation?
