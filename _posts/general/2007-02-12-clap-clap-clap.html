<p align="center"><strong>Warning: this is a bad post!</strong></p>
Applauding's time during meeting ... clap clap clap ... today (again) made me think to the sound of the steps of the "stupid mule" following the man who gives it the heavy duty! worst, the mule often carry the rewarding food it will got!<br/>
That's not that I don't ike to applaud: I do think <em>dedicate work</em> and <em>recognize good work</em> is really better than the work itself! But please, don't ask me to applaud ... I will do it by myself!<br/>
Yeah, I'm a bit sad/angry ... and I like to write in this mood ... and I LOVE/NEED blues music, my liberty universe!<br/>
Note: I'm sorry for those strong animals (mules), they're good!, I just needed a metaphor to express myself.
