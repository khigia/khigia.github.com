 This is my first blog: hopefully I will make progress in writing after a while ... please be patient ;)<br/>
This is also my first English writing: I mean first text willingly written in English just for fun. We'll see if the spell checker is good. Making this blog will certainly encourage me to use my new <a href="http://www.macmillandictionary.com//aboutonline.htm" title="about MacMillan dictiorany online version">MacMillan dictionary</a>   for English learners: easy to search, easy to read with highlight of very common words (the "must know"), and easy to understand with very simple definitions. Particularity of this dictionary is that all the definitions are given using only a very small subset of English words, which is called the base vocabulary. I purchase the book version and got in same time free access to the on line version, which is really good and have the wonderful advantage of giving pronunciation by sound media.
