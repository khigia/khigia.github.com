STM stand for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_transactional_memory" target="_blank" title="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_transactional_memory" class="externalLink">Software Transactional Memory</a>. How does it drive me to anarchy? because I get lost again following all the web links!<br/>
In fact I was wondering where to get some information about this mechanism used in some concurrency models. For those like me who like concrete explanation, I recommend to read <a href="http://armstrongonsoftware.blogspot.com/2006/09/pure-and-simple-transaction-memories.html" target="_blank" title="//armstrongonsoftware.blogspot.com/2006/09/pure-and-simple-transaction-memories.html" class="externalLink">this blog post from Joe Armstrong</a> then <a href="http://lambda-the-ultimate.org/node/1964" target="_blank" title="//lambda-the-ultimate.org/node/1964" class="externalLink">beautiful concurrency</a> for more details.<br/>
And if you are still wondering why I wrote the term "anarchy", it's just because I read about the work of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audrey_Tang" target="_blank" title="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audrey_Tang" class="externalLink">Audrey Tang</a> who integrated STM in <a href="http://www.pugscode.org/" target="_blank" title="//www.pugscode.org/" class="externalLink">Pugs (an Haskell implementation of Perl)</a> ... and she also appears to be a proponent of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Individualist_anarchism" target="_blank" title="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Individualist_anarchism" class="externalLink">Individualist Anarchism</a>.
