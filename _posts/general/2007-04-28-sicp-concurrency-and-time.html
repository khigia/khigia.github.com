This was too simple, so why wasn't I aware of that? concurrency and time is the same thing ... or <a href="http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/full-text/book/book-Z-H-23.html#%25_sec_3.4">at least you cannot have one without the other</a>, logic!
I'm currently in a "back to basic" phase ... but I don't have enough time: how can I manage to implement stream, while reading the meta-circular evaluator chapter, and also having a "normal" life? time and concurrency ...
