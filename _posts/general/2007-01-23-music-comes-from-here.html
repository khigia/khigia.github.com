This evening my <a href="http://pandora.com/" target="_blank" title="//pandora.com" class="externalLink">pandora</a> radios navigate from Tab Benoit to Popa Chubby by Melvin Taylor, and from Buddy Guy to Robert Lowery ... even better than a random selection on my hard-drive since my collection is quite limited!<br/>
But <em>the evening's question</em> is not about blues nor guitar, it is a question about physic: isn't my brain afraid of my headset? if my brain has a pure stereophonic analysis model to locate the sound source, it should conclude that it come from the center of my head, isn't it? ... I listen again, and yes, sound comes from there. Good brain, not as afraid as I am.
