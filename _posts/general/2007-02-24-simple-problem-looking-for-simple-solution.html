I use Vim in a Gnome Terminal in a Ubuntu/Gnome desktop, with the terminal fullscreen mode option ... and thus can't see the popups of Gaim/Skype (I don't want to use the sound alert to not disturb my colleagues)! I would love to see the small message near tray icon that I normally got in "not-terminal-fullscreen mode". Maybe I should switch back to XFCE ...
