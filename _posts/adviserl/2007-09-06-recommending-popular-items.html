The prediction module using Slope-One algorithm can compute popular items.<br/>
In this implementation, popular items are not only the most frequent items. Each user's ratings defines some kind of relative order of a subset of items. The prediction module compute some kind of global order for all items by merging all "user subset's orders". This is actually using Slope-One algorithm for a user which would rate all items with same score.<br/>
Popular items recommendation is useful for new user!
