Did I say adviserl need doc and testing ... well ... I did implemented something else: a (too) simple HTTP API based on inets. It enable rating of items and retrieving recommendations. Hopefully it will also display few info about state of adviserl application. If set in config file, adviserl will start inets at startup.
